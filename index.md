## About me

I am a Particle Physicist, working with the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. My main activities are data analysis and development of software needed for running such an experiment. On this website, I will share stuff I find useful, be it for programming, computer configuration, or general knowledge, mainly for my own bookkeping, but putting it online in case it can help somebody else out there.
